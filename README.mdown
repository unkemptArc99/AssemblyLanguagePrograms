## Assembly Language Sample Programs

**Using NASM as the assembler**
Just doing a hands-on work on assembly language in my college course. Thought that I could share it with you all :)

1. Lab01
  * A program for finding the palindrome of string. Works only if case of both the characters are same.
  * A program to encode the numbers in a string with a rule given in the problem statement. 

2. Lab02
  * A program to add two matrices A and B and give the resulting output in matrix C.
